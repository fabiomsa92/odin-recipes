            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This cauliflower pizza crust is a delicious gluten-free alternative. If you'd never heard about pizza before and someone served this to you, you'd really enjoy it. Texture aside, the flavor of this final product was very pizza-like, and I'll be doing further experiments to be sure.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="ul-recipe">
                <li>1 head cauliflower, cored and separated into florets</li>
                <li>½ cup water</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>2 ounces fresh goat cheese</li>
                <li>½ ounce finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <Ol class="ol-recipe">
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Place cauliflower into a food processor; blend until finely ground. </li>
                <li>Cook cauliflower, water, and salt in a large skillet over medium-high heat until fragrant and most of the water is evaporated, 5 to 6 minutes. Cool completely. </li>
                <li>Transfer cauliflower to the center of a clean dish towel. Wrap and squeeze tightly to remove excess moisture. You should have about 1 1/2 cups cauliflower pulp. </li>
                <li>Stir together cauliflower pulp, egg, goat cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl to form a soft dough. Gather into a ball and place in the center of the prepared baking sheet. Press dough into a circle, about 1/4-inch thick. </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 40 minutes. Cool and turn crust over before topping. </li>
